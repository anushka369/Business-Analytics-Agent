    "# Building a Local Agent with Strands Agents and Ollama Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to create a personal agent using Strands Agent and Ollama. The agent will be capable of performing various local tasks such as file operations, web searches, and system commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Ollama?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is an open-source framework that allows you to run large language models (LLMs) locally on your machine. It provides a simple API for interacting with these models, making it ideal for privacy-focused applications where you don't want to send data to external services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key benefits of Ollama:\n",
    "- **Privacy**: All processing happens locally on your machine\n",
    "- **No API costs**: Free to use as much as you want\n",
    "- **Offline capability**: Works without internet connection\n",
    "- **Customization**: Can be fine-tuned for specific use \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've created a local personal agent using Stands and Ollama. The agent can perform file operations (read, write, append) and Summarize/Analyze text\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates the power of running AI models locally with Ollama, combined with the flexibility of strands' tool system. You can extend this agent by adding more tools or using different Ollama models based on your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps (Ideas)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try different Ollama models to see how they affect the agent's capabilities\n",
    "- Add more complex tools like web search, email sending, or calendar integration\n",
    "- Implement memory for the agent to remember past interactions\n",
    "- Create a simple UI for interacting with your agent"
