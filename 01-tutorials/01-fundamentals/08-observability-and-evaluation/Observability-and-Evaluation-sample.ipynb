    "# Evaluating Strands Agent with Observability with LangFuse and Evaluation with RAGAS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this example we will demonstrate how to build an agent with observability and evaluation. We will leverage [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) to process the Strands Agent traces and [Ragas](https://www.ragas.io/) metrics to evaluate the performance of  agent. The primary focus is on agent evaluation the quality of responses generated by the Agent use the traces produced by the SDK. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strands Agents have build-in support for observability with LangFuse. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to collect the data from Langfuse, apply transformation as needed by Ragas, conduct evaluations, and finally associate the scores back to the traces. Having the traces and the scores in one place allows for deeper dives, trend analysis, and continous improvement.\n",

    "- Pushes evaluation scores back to Langfuse for a complete feedback loop\n",
    "- Evaluate both single-turn (with context) and multi-turn conversations"

    "## Define Ragas Metrics\n",
    "Ragas provides a suite of agentic metrics designed to evaluate the conversational and decision-making capabilities of AI agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In agentic workflows, it’s not only important to assess whether an agent accomplishes a task, but also whether it aligns with specific qualitative or strategic business goals—such as enhancing customer satisfaction, promoting upsell opportunities, or maintaining brand voice. To support these broader evaluation needs, the Ragas framework allows users to define **custom evaluation metrics**, empowering teams to tailor assessments based on what matters most to their business or application context. Two such customizable and flexible metrics are the **Aspect Critic Metric** and the **Rubric Score Metric**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Aspect Criteria** metric is a **binary evaluation metric** that determines whether an agent’s response satisfies a **specific user-defined criterion**. These criteria can represent any desirable aspect of an agent’s behavior—such as offering alternatives, following ethical guidelines, or expressing empathy.\n",
    "- The **Rubric Score** metric goes a step further by allowing for **discrete multi-level scoring**, as opposed to simple binary outputs. This metric lets you define a rubric—a set of distinct scores, each accompanied by an explanation or requirement—and then uses an LLM to determine which score best reflects the quality or characteristics of a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate our agent, let's now set a couple of **AspectCritic** metrics"

The RAG metrics, offered by the Ragas framework, are designed specifically to evaluate the effectiveness of RAG systems by measuring both the quality of retrieved documents and the faithfulness of the generated output. These metrics are vital because a failure in retrieval or grounding can lead to hallucinated or misleading responses, even if the agent appears coherent or fluent.\n",
