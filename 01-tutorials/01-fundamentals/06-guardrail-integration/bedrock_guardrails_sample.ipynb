    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this example we will guide you through how to create your first Strands Agent using [Amazon Bedrock Guardrails](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/guardrails/) to safeguard the underlying Amazon Bedrock LLM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock Guardrails provides configurable safeguards to help safely build generative AI applications at scale. With a consistent and standard approach used across a wide range of foundation models (FMs) including FMs supported in Amazon Bedrock, fine-tuned models, and models hosted outside of Amazon Bedrock, Guardrails delivers industry-leading safety protections. \n",
    "\n",
    "With Strands Agents, you can add Amazon Bedrock Guardrails directly to you Amazon Bedrock models. If you are not using Amazon Bedrock Models, you can use the [Apply Guardrail API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails-use-independent-api.html) to safeguard any model. In this case, you need to build the pipelines using the advance processing capabilities you just learned.\n",

    "Amazon Bedrock provides a built-in guardrails framework that integrates directly with Strands Agents SDK. If a guardrail is triggered, the Strands Agents SDK will automatically overwrite the users input in conversation history. This is done so that follow-up questions are not also blocked by the same questions. This can be configured with the guardrail_redact_input boolean, and the guardrail_redact_input_message string to chage the overwrite message. Additionally, the same functionality is built for the model's output, but this is disabled by default. You can enable this with the guardrail_redact_output boolean, and change the overwrite message with the guardrail_redact_output_message string. Below is an example of how to leverage Bedrock guardrails in your code:"
