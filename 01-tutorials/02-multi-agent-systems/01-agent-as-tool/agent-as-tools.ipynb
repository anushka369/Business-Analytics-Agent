    "\"Agents as Tools\" is an architectural pattern in AI systems where specialized AI agents are wrapped as callable functions (tools) that can be used by other agents. This creates a hierarchical structure where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A primary \"orchestrator\" agent handles user interaction and determines which specialized agent to call\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Specialized \"tool agents\" perform domain-specific tasks when called by the orchestrator\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach mimics human team dynamics, where a manager coordinates specialists, each bringing unique expertise to solve complex problems. Rather than a single agent trying to handle everything, tasks are delegated to the most appropriate specialized agent.\n",

      "# Generative AI: A Comprehensive Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of generating new content such as text, images, audio, video, code, and 3D models that resemble but are distinct from their training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Core Technologies\n",
      "\n",
      "### Foundation Models\n",
      "Large-scale AI models trained on vast datasets that serve as the base for various applications:\n",
      "- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Systems like GPT-4 (OpenAI), PaLM/Gemini (Google), Claude (Anthropic), and Llama (Meta) that generate human-like text[1][2].\n",
      "- **Diffusion Models**: Power most modern image generation systems like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion[3].\n",
      "- **Multimodal Models**: Systems that work across different data types, like GPT-4V, Gemini, and Claude Opus, integrating text, images, and sometimes audio[2].\n",
      "\n",
      "### Technical Foundations\n",
      "- **Transformer Architecture**: The dominant neural network architecture powering most modern generative AI systems[4].\n",
      "- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Used to align AI outputs with human preferences[5].\n",
      "- **Diffusion Processes**: Mathematical frameworks for gradually adding and then removing noise from data to generate new content[3].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Applications\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative AI has found applications across numerous domains:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Content Creation**: Text generation, image creation, music composition, video synthesis\n",
      "- **Software Development**: Code generation, debugging assistance, documentation writing\n",
      "- **Design**: Product design, architectural visualization, fashion design\n",
      "- **Healthcare**: Drug discovery, medical imaging analysis, personalized treatment plans\n",
      "- **Education**: Personalized tutoring, content summarization, assessment generation\n",
      "- **Business**: Customer service automation, data analysis, marketing content creation\n",
      "\n",
      "## Market and Economic Impact\n",
      "\n",
      "The generative AI market is experiencing explosive growth:\n",
      "- Estimated to grow from $13.3 billion in 2023 to $22.1 billion in 2024[6]\n",
      "- Projected to reach over $100 billion by 2030[6]\n",
      "- Major investments from tech companies: Microsoft ($13B in OpenAI), Google, Amazon, and others[7]\n",
      "\n",
      "## Challenges and Concerns\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative AI faces several significant challenges:\n",
      "- **Misinformation**: Ability to create convincing false content\n",
      "- **Copyright and IP issues**: Questions about ownership of AI-generated works\n",
      "- **Bias and fairness**: Systems can perpetuate or amplify biases in training data\n",
      "- **Privacy concerns**: Training data may contain private information\n",
      "- **Labor market disruption**: Potential automation of creative and knowledge work\n",
      "- **Resource requirements**: Large models require significant computing resources\n",
