# State Management in Strands Agents

This sample demonstrates how to use agent state to build stateful agents that remember information across interactions.

## Key Concepts

- **Agent State**: Persistent storage hidden from the model, accessible to tools
- **Conversation History**: Messages passed to the model for reasoning
- **Hooks**: Track and respond to agent lifecycle events

## What This Demo Does

![Architecture](./images/architecture.png)

Creates a shopping assistant that:
- Tracks the user ID as part of the agent state
- Tracks items in a user's cart in an external store
- Remembers user preferences
- Provides tools to add/remove items and view cart
- Uses hooks to log activity and store conversation history

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── index.ts      # CLI entry point, conversation loop
├── agent.ts      # Agent configuration, tools, hooks
└── database.ts   # Dummy DB implementation that persists data in a database.json file
```

The database is a simple JSON file-based implementation for demo purposes. In production, you'd use a real database.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- AWS Bedrock access

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Run
Run your agent

```bash
npm start YOUR_USER_ID 
```

## Testing Journey

Follow this sequence to see state persistence in action:

1. **Introduce yourself**: "My name is Alex"
2. **Set preferences**: "I prefer USD currency and cash payment"
3. **Browse products**: "Show me laptop prices"
4. **Add items**: "Add a laptop and a mouse to my cart"
5. **Remove item**: "Remove the mouse, I already have one"
6. **Exit**: Type "exit"
7. **Restart**: Run `npm start` again
8. **Verify persistence**: "What's my name and what are my preferences?"

The agent should remember your name, preferences, and cart contents across sessions.

## Key Takeaways

- State persists across invocations but is hidden from the model
- Tools access state via `context.agent.state`
- Conversation history is what the model sees
- Hooks let you track agent behavior
