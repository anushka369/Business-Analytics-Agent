In this case you can still use the decorator approach or you could also define your function using a TOOL_SPEC dictionary. The formating is similar to the one used by the [Amazon Bedrock Converse API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/tool-use-examples.html) for tool usage. In this case you are more flexible to define the required parameters as well as the return of success and error executions and TOOL_SPEC definitions will work in this case."
